# Invoking workflows per host

**Worker guard (applies to every route below):** if the `ULTRACODE_INSIDE_RUN`
environment variable is set, you are a worker inside an ultracode run — never
dispatch workflows by ANY route (CLI, MCP, native tool). Do your assigned task
directly. The routes below are for interactive hosts orchestrating on a user's
behalf.

## Dispatch order

1. **Qoder native Workflow tool** (qodercli / Qoder IDE with the tool registered): invoke it directly, or install the script to `.qoder/workflows/<name>.js` and run by name. Native resume: `resumeFromRunId: "wf_..."`. Caveats: `budget` global is stubbed (`{total:null}`) — pass `args.budgetTokens` and gate manually; no portable per-call `effort` or `contextWindow` (define a subagent in `.qoder/agents/` with frontmatter `effort:` and use `agentType`); never name anything `Workflow`, `workflows`, or `deep-research`.
2. **ultracode MCP tools** (`workflow_start` / `workflow_status` / `workflow_result` / `workflow_stop` / `workflow_list`):
   - `workflow_start {script | scriptPath, backend?, model?, effort?, contextWindow?, args?, budget?, maxConcurrency?, wallClockMs?, attemptTimeoutMs?, resumeFromRunId?}` → returns `{runId}` in <1s. The run survives your turn because the MCP **server process** owns it — which makes this the only reliable route from a sandboxed host shell. A fresh start resolves `backend` from the call or layered ultracode config; without either it is rejected. **Omit `backend`, `model`, `effort`, and `contextWindow` unless the user explicitly requested overrides; never infer the worker backend from the current host.** An explicit backend switch does not inherit configured model controls and returns a warning naming the dropped fields. If controls are incompatible with the selected backend, stop and ask the user instead of rewriting or retrying them. `mock` returns fabricated stubs for rehearsal only, so always use a real backend for real work. `contextWindow` is a positive-integer Qoder-only default (Qoder CLI ≥1.1.1). Resume inherits the prior run's frozen model controls unless its backend is explicitly switched. `wallClockMs` (run cap) and `attemptTimeoutMs` (per-attempt cap) are unclamped and default to UNLIMITED on a fresh start — **opt-in like budgets: pass them ONLY when the user explicitly asked for a time limit — never invent one.** On resume an omitted cap inherits the prior run's value; pass `0` to clear an inherited cap back to unlimited.
   - Monitor with `workflow_status {runId, until: 'terminal', waitSeconds: N}` — the **quiet monitor**: parks silently, wakes only when the run ends or after N seconds (re-issue the same call; timed-out polls are harmless), and rolls the last 40 log lines into each response. `until: 'phase'` additionally wakes at each phase boundary — use it when the user should see milestone updates, and chain `sinceEventOffset: <nextEventOffset>` on every re-issue (an unchained phase hold wakes instantly on the already-consumed boundary in the backlog). Every wake costs a model turn, so use the largest N your host's MCP tool timeout allows: `ultracode install codex` pins `tool_timeout_sec = 3600` (user scope) → **`waitSeconds: 3300`**; stock codex 300 → 240; Qoder/Gemini 600 → 540. Holds dying early mean your config pins a lower timeout — drop N below the cutoff and re-run `ultracode install codex`. A crashed runner flips the run terminal (`orphaned`) within a tick, and a wedged-but-alive runner (heartbeat stale >30s) wakes the hold with `stale: true` — diagnose then (`ultracode status`/`logs`, or `workflow_stop`) instead of re-parking.
   - **Between wakes, silence is correct.** A parked monitor is idle time, not "ongoing work": there is nothing to report (failures wake you), so do not emit "still running" commentary, do not abandon a hold to re-poll for reassurance, and do not tail `.ultracode/runs/` mid-hold — every one of those costs a turn and delivers no information the wake wouldn't. Host rules about frequent updates or avoiding long waits target active work, not a parked monitor: if your host wraps MCP calls in an exec/code cell, collect with ONE wait whose yield (e.g. `yield_time_ms`) covers the hold — not ≤60s slices with narration between. Narrate only at wakes: phase boundaries (`until: 'phase'`), terminal, or genuinely new information.
   - Stream with `workflow_status {runId, waitSeconds: 25, sinceEventOffset}` (default `until: 'activity'`) — returns fresh log tail + `nextEventOffset` as soon as anything renders. Every wake is a full model turn: use it while actively debugging, not to babysit a long run.
   - `workflow_result {runId}` when status is terminal → full output (result, failures, usage, artifact paths).
3. **Shell CLI**:
   ```bash
   ultracode validate my.workflow.js          # meta + dialect + compile check
   ultracode run my.workflow.js --dry-run     # free rehearsal on the mock backend
   ultracode run my.workflow.js --yes [--budget <ONLY if the user specified one>] [--detach]
   ultracode run my.workflow.js --backend <USER-SELECTED> [--model M] [--effort E] --yes
   ultracode watch <runId>                    # live panel; status <runId> --watch for script-friendly output
   ultracode logs <runId> --follow | stop <runId>
   ultracode resume <runId> [--script edited.js]
   ultracode doctor                           # backend availability + auth mode table
   ```
   `--detach` is for **persistent shells only** — see lifecycle discipline below.

## Backend notes (ultracode engine workers)

| backend | worker CLI | structured output | parallel-safe auth |
|---|---|---|---|
| codex | `codex exec --json` (+ rollout sidecar for live tokens/model) | native `--output-schema` (strict subset) | `CODEX_API_KEY` |
| qoder | `qodercli --print` (`--reasoning-effort` / `--context-window` on ≥1.1.1) | native `--json-schema` (+ engine revalidation) | `QODER_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` (beware stored /login creds) |
| claude | `claude -p` | native `--json-schema` | CLI-managed |
| gemini | `gemini -p` | emulated (prompt contract + validate/retry) | `GEMINI_API_KEY` — no headless resume: task retries always respawn fresh |
| mock | built-in | schema-aware stubs | n/a — free, use for --dry-run |

Permission is user-controlled: default to `--permission auto` and pass a user-specified permission verbatim. `--permission safe` is backend-asymmetric: codex maps it to a read-only **sandbox** (workers still execute commands — queries and profilers work, writes/network blocked); claude (`default`) and qoder (`dont_ask`) map it to headless **permission modes** that auto-reject every tool call — those workers can only read files and reason. A workflow whose agents must run read-only commands breaks SILENTLY when switched from codex to claude/qoder under `safe`: agents report "unverified"/empty results and there is NO engine warning (the "actions auto-rejected" warning is codex-only — its adapter is the only one that emits declined tool events). If the user asked for `safe` and workers need to execute read-only commands, tell the user and embed the evidence in prompts instead.

## Workflow lifecycle discipline

- Always `validate` then `--dry-run` before spending tokens: dialect errors, cap misconfigurations, and schema mistakes surface for free.
- **Sandboxed host shells kill detached runs.** If your shell commands run inside a sandbox (Codex workspace-write exec, any per-command jail), a `--detach`ed runner CANNOT outlive your tool call: the sandbox's PID namespace is torn down when the command returns and the kernel SIGKILLs everything inside — no logs, no finalization. Symptom: `status` shows `orphaned` within seconds, manifest `pid` ≤ 64, empty runner.log. Route through the MCP server instead, or ask the user to launch from a persistent shell / escalate the command. (Also: codex workers cannot spawn inside Codex's own sandbox — `~/.codex` state is read-only there and network is off — so from a Codex host either use MCP or a non-codex worker backend.)
- **After ANY launch, verify liveness before doing anything else**: first `workflow_status` poll or `ultracode status <runId>`. `orphaned` at launch = the run is dead; diagnose (see above), don't wait on it. Then park on the quiet monitor (`until: 'terminal'`) until terminal — never abandon a started run, and never do the subtask work inline yourself while it runs.
- Long runs: `--detach` (persistent shells only), then `ultracode watch <runId>` / poll `status`. The watch panel is interactive on a TTY: ↑/↓ (j/k) select an agent, ⏎ opens its detail view (prompt, tool activity, outcome), esc backs out (overview: clears selection), q detach. The run store (`.ultracode/runs/<runId>/`) holds `output.json`, `journal.jsonl`, `events.jsonl`, and per-agent `agents/<seq>-<label>/{prompt.md, result.json, transcript.jsonl}` — cite these paths when reporting (`prompt.md` lands at agent start, `result.json` at settle). The dir name zero-pads seq to 4 and slugifies the label, e.g. `agents/0003-audit-src-foo-ts/`.
- On failure: read `output.json` `failures[]` first (every cap trip, declined action, and agent error lands there), then `resume` — completed agents replay free.
- Report faithfully: surface `failures[]` and warnings to the user even when the run "succeeded".
